## Features

- Updated example in the [introduction](../index.html) to reflect data that is now included in the cchsflow package.

### Variables

-  <font color="green">**New**</font> [DHHGAGE_C](../reference/DHHGAGE_cat_fun.html) - categorical age variable that groups various age categories across all CCHS cycles. Based on the continuous age variable (`DHHGAGE_cont`) that is also harmonious across all CCHS cycles.
-  <font color = "green">**New**</font> WTS_M - sampling weight variable
-  <font color = "green">**New**</font> DHHGHSZ - household size
-  <font color = "green">**New**</font> INCGHH_A, INCGHH_B, INCGHH_C, INCGHH_cont - Total household income from all sources. The categories for household income vary across CCHS cycles so three categorical variables were added along with a continuous variable that harmonizes household income across all CCHS cycles by taking the midpoint of each category.
